##Communication Format

###JSON Format (RPi communication with Android and PC)

####Received by RPi
```
{
	type: "command" / "movement"
	data (command)	: "START_EXP" / "START_PATH" / "STOP"
	data (movement)	: "LRL4RRL"
}
```
####Sent from RPi
```
{
	type: "map" / "status" /
	data (map): {
		UL		: #
		IRLF	: #
		IRRF	: #
		UL		: #
		IRL		: #
		UR		: #
		IRR		: #
        X       : #
        Y       : #
	}
	data (status): "END_EXP" / "END_PATH"
}
```

###RPi/PC -> Arduino
All ```Numbers``` and ```Chars```

Start command ```S```

number for go ahead ```x``` grids

Char for turning

```L``` for left 90

```R``` for right 90

```D``` for drift //for demo

####example
```
4 L 3 R R 1
```

####Arduino Send
```Arduino
    Serial.println("UF " + String(u_F_dis));
    Serial.println("IRLF " + String(ir_lf_dis));
    Serial.println("IRRF " + String(ir_rf_dis));

    Serial.println("UL " + String(u_L_dis));
    Serial.println("IRL " + String(ir_l_dis));
    
    Serial.println("UR " + String(u_R_dis));
    Serial.println("IRR " + String(ir_r_dis));
```
####Arduino Get
```Arduino
while (!Serial.available() || Serial.read() != 'S'); //Start command

while (!Serial.available() || Serial.read() != 'P'); //Shortest Path
```
