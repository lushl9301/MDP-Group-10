##Communication Format

###JSON Format (RPi communication with Android and PC)

####Received by RPi
```
{
	type: "command" / "movement"
	data (command)	: "START_EXP" / "START_PATH" / "STOP"
	data (movement)	: "LRL4RRL"
}
```
####Sent from RPi
```
{
	type: "reading" / "status" / "map"
	data (reading): {
		U_F		    : #
		U_R	        : #
		U_L	        : #
		short_LF	: #
		short_RF	: #
		short_FR	: #
		long_BL		: #
        X           : #
        Y           : #
        direction   : #
	}
	data (status)   : "END_EXP" / "END_PATH"
    data (map)      : []
}
```

###RPi/PC -> Arduino
All ```Numbers``` and ```Chars```

Start command ```S```

number for go ahead ```x``` grids

Char for turning

```L``` for left 90

```R``` for right 90

```D``` for drift //for demo

####example
```
4 L 3 R R 1
```

####Arduino Send
```Arduino
    Serial.println("UF " + String(u_F_dis));
    Serial.println("IRLF " + String(ir_lf_dis));
    Serial.println("IRRF " + String(ir_rf_dis));

    Serial.println("UL " + String(u_L_dis));
    Serial.println("IRL " + String(ir_l_dis));
    
    Serial.println("UR " + String(u_R_dis));
    Serial.println("IRR " + String(ir_r_dis));
```
####Arduino Get
```Arduino
while (!Serial.available() || Serial.read() != 'S'); //Start command

while (!Serial.available() || Serial.read() != 'P'); //Shortest Path
```

##Communication Scenarios

###Exploration
* Exploration Start:
Android -> (command to start exploration) -> RPi -> (command to start exploration) -> Arduino

* Exploration:
Arduino -> (sensor readings, direction, coordinate) -> RPi -> (sensor readings, direction, coordinate) -> PC & Android

* Exploration End:
Arduino -> (status exploration end) -> RPi -> (status exploration end) -> Android & PC 
PC -> (map matrix) -> RPi -> (map matrix) -> Android

###Shortest Path
* Shortest Path Start:
Android -> (command to start shortest path) -> RPi -> (command to start shortest path) -> Arduino & PC

PC -> (shortest path movement) -> RPi -> (shortest path movement) -> Arduino

* Shortest Path:
