##Communication Format
###RPi/PC -> Arduino
All ```Numbers``` and ```Chars```

Start command ```S```

number for go ahead ```x``` grids
Char for turning

```L``` for left 90

```R``` for right 90

```D``` for drift //for demo

####example
```
4 L 3 R R 1
```

####Arduino Send
```Arduino
Serial.println("=============");
Serial.println("F30"); //30cm in front
Serial.print("L40"); //40cm on left
Serial.print("R5"); //5cm on right
```
####Arduino Get
```Arduino
while (!Serial.available() || Serial.read() != 'S'); //Start command

while (!Serial.available() || Serial.read() != 'P'); //Shortest Path
```
