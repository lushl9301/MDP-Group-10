##Communication Format

###JSON Format (RPi communication with Android and PC)

####Received by RPi
```
{
	type: "command" / "movement" / "path"
	data (command)	: "S" (initiate robot) / "E" (exploration) / "P" (shortest path) / "R" (remote-control)
	data (movement)	: "L" / "R" / "1" / "G" (stop)
    data (path)     : "LR1" / "G" (stop)
}
```
####Sent from RPi
```
{
	type: "reading" / "status" / "map"
	data (reading): {
		U_F		    : #
		U_R	        : #
		U_L	        : #
		short_LF	: #
		short_RF	: #
		short_FR	: #
		long_BL		: #
        X           : #
        Y           : #
        direction   : #
	}
	data (status)   : "END_EXP" / "END_PATH" / "END_RMT"
    data (map)      : [](map matrix)
}

```

###RPi/PC -> Arduino
All ```Numbers``` and ```Chars```

Start command ```S```

number for go ahead ```x``` grids

Char for turning

```L``` for left 90

```R``` for right 90

```D``` for drift //for demo

####example
```
4 L 3 R R 1
```

####Arduino Send
```Arduino
    JsonObject<10> talk_Json;
    talk_Json["X"] = currentX;
    talk_Json["Y"] = currentY;
    talk_Json["direction"] = pwd;

    talk_Json["U_F"] = u_F_dis;
    talk_Json["U_R"] = u_R_dis;
    talk_Json["U_L"] = u_L_dis;

    talk_Json["short_LF"] = ir_lf_dis;
    talk_Json["short_RF"] = ir_rf_dis;

    talk_Json["short_FR"] = ir_r_dis;

    talk_Json["long_BL"] = ir_l_dis;
    Serial.print(talk_Json);
    Serial.println();
    //eg.
    //{"X":10,"Y":7,"direction":1,"U_F":5,"U_R":20,"U_L":231,"short_LF":659,"short_RF":608,"short_FR":354,"long_BL":216}
    //
```
####Arduino Get
```Arduino
while (!Serial.available() || Serial.read() != 'S'); //Start command

while (!Serial.available() || Serial.read() != 'P'); //Shortest Path
```
